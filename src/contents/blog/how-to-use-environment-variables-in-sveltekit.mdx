## What is an environment variable?

Environment variables are variables in your system that describe your environment.

For example, on Unix-like operating systems like Mac and Linux, if we type `echo $HOME` in the terminal, we will get the path to home. The same is true if we type `echo $PATH` to list the path to an executable file.

We can set environment variables and they are useful for knowing whether you are in development or production or storing API tokens securely.

In development, you store environment variables in a `.env` file which should be added to `.gitignore`.

To help yourself and others in the future, it is a good idea to create a `.env.example` file with placeholder values â€‹â€‹that are safe to upload so you know what keys you need.

## Using Environment Variables in Sveltekit

SvelteKit exposes four different `modules` for handling environment variables:

- `Static`
  - [`$env/static/private`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules)
  - [`$env/static/public`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules)
- `Dynamic`
  - [`$env/dynamic/private`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules)
  - [`$env/dynamic/public`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules)

You can load environment variables however you want like using `import.meta.env` from Vite or dotenv but itâ€™s easier and more secure if you use the built-in modules SvelteKit provides.

### Static for variables during the build process

If youâ€™re not sure which one to pick you probably want to use `$env/static` variables which are imported during build time.

If you have an `.env` file or store your environment variables somewhere else the next steps are the same.

```yaml
.env

# Private
SECRET_API_KEY=secret

# Public
PUBLIC_API_KEY=public
```

For `.server` use private environment and for client side we can use public environment with `PUBLIC_` prefix.

```ts
+page.server.ts

import { SECRET_API_KEY } from '$env/static/private'

export async function load() {
  console.log(SECRET_API_KEY) // secret ðŸ¤«
}
```

Private environment can only be used with server side e.g. pages in `.server` route

```ts
+page.ts

import { PUBLIC_API_KEY } from '$env/static/public'

export async function load() {
  console.log(PUBLIC_API_KEY) // public ðŸ“£
}
```

Public environment can only be used with client side.

### Dynamic for variables during runtime

If you have environment variables that change or you can't set them during build, you can use the `$env/dynamic` import which allows you to access environment variables from the platform your application is running on.

Use `$env/dynamic/private` to get access to environment variables equivalent to `process.env`

```ts
+page.server.ts

import { env } from '$env/dynamic/private'

export async function load() {
  console.log(env.SECRET_API_KEY) // secret ðŸ¤«
}
```

Use `$env/dynamic/public` to get access to environment variables prefixed with `PUBLIC_`

```ts
+page.ts

import { env } from '$env/dynamic/public'

export async function load() {
  console.log(env.PUBLIC_API_KEY) // public ðŸ“£
}
```

## Conclusion

Environment variables are used for development process, it is important in development. There are many ways to use environment variables and you can also manage the environment with a third party to secure the environment variables.
Sveltekit provides several ways to use environment variables scoped as `static` or `dynamic`.
