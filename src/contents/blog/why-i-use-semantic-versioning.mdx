What do version numbers mean? 

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a versioning scheme for software that aims to convey meaning about the underlying changes in a release. 

![Semantiv Version](/static/blog/semantic-version/1720626312974.gif)
 
#### SemVer uses a three-part version number: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. 
 
- MAJOR version: Incremented when there are incompatible API changes. 
- MINOR version: Incremented when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner. 
- PATCH version: Incremented when backward-compatible bug fixes are made. 
 
#### Example Workflow 
- Initial Development Phase 

Start with version `0.1.0`

- First Stable Release 

Reach a stable release: `1.0.0`

- Subsequent Changes 

Patch Release: A bug fix is needed for `1.0.0` Update to `1.0.1`

Minor Release: A new, backward-compatible feature is added to `1.0.3` Update to `1.1.0`

Major Release: A significant change that is not backward-compatible is introduced in `1.2.2` Update to `2.0.0`
 
- Special Versions and Pre-releases 

Pre-release Versions: `1.0.0-alpha`, `1.0.0-beta`, `1.0.0-rc.1`

Build Metadata: `1.0.0+20130313144700`

## Conclusion

With SemVer we know about app versioning, so when you're developing an app, you know you're building a feature or fixing a bug. We can use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for automatic release applications.
