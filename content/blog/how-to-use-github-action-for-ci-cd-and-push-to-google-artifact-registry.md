## Introduction

In this guide, we will explore how to set up a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process and push artifacts to Google Artifact Registry. We will cover the following topics:

- Configuring the workflow
- Integrating GitHub Actions with Google Cloud
- Securely managing authentication

By following this guide, you will be able to streamline your development workflow and improve deployment consistency.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub account
- A Google Cloud account
- A Google Cloud project
- A Google Cloud Artifact Registry repository

## Step 1: Create a GitHub repository

First, create a new GitHub repository for your project. You can do this by navigating to the GitHub website and clicking on the "New repository" button. Follow the prompts to create a new repository with the desired name and description.

## Step 2: Create a Google Cloud project

Next, create a new Google Cloud project. You can do this by navigating to the Google Cloud console and clicking on the "Create project" button. Follow the prompts to create a new project with the desired name and region.

## Step 3: Create a Google Cloud Artifact Registry repository

After creating a new Google Cloud project, you will need to create a new Artifact Registry repository. You can do this by navigating to the Artifact Registry section of the Google Cloud console and clicking on the "Create repository" button. Follow the prompts to create a new repository with the desired name and description.

## Step 4: Configure the workflow

Now that we have our repository and Artifact Registry repository set up, we can configure the workflow. We will use the following steps to configure the workflow:

1. Create a new file named `.github/workflows/build.yml` in the root of your repository.
2. Add the following code to the file:

```yaml
name: Build and deploy

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      IMAGE_NAME: api # your image name
      PROJECT_ID: membagii # your project id
      ARTIFACT_REGION: asia-southeast2-docker.pkg.dev # Artifact Registry Region
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Github Tag Release Version # set release version from tag name
        id: latestTag
        run: |-
          echo "Tag name from GITHUB_REF_NAME: $GITHUB_REF_NAME"
          echo "RELEASE_VERSION=release-${{ github.ref_name }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV 
      
      - name: Google Cloud Platform Auth
        uses: "google-github-actions/auth@v1"
        with:
          credentials_json: "${{ secrets.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}"

      - name: "Set up Cloud SDK"
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: |-
          docker build -t ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest .

      - name: Configure Docker Client
        run: |-
          gcloud auth configure-docker --quiet
          gcloud auth configure-docker ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }} --quiet
      
      - name: Push Docker Image to Artifact Registry
        run: |-
          docker tag ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest
          docker tag ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:release
          docker tag ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}
          docker push ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest
          docker push ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:release
          docker push ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}

      - name: Call Webhook # optional
        uses: joelwmale/webhook-action@2.3.2
        env:
          IMAGE_REGISTRY: Google Cloud Artifact
          IMAGE_REPOSITORY: ${{ env.ARTIFACT_REGION }}/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/images/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL }}/api/v1/workflow-github?telegram_chat_id=${{ env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }}&slack_channel=${{ env.SLACK_CHANNEL_ID }}&registry=${{ env.IMAGE_REGISTRY }}
          body: '{"push_data":{"tag":"${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}"},"repository":{"name":"${{ env.IMAGE_REPOSITORY }}"}}'

```

This workflow will be triggered whenever a push tagging version is made to the repository. It will first check out the code from the repository. Then, it will set up Docker, which is a tool for building and pushing Docker images. Next, it will log in to the Google Artifact Registry using the provided credentials. Finally, it will build and push the Docker image to the Artifact Registry.

## Step 5: Integrate GitHub Actions with Google Cloud

To integrate GitHub Actions with Google Cloud, you will need to create a service account and generate a JSON key file. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Create a new service account in the Google Cloud console. You can do this by navigating to the IAM & admin section of the Google Cloud console and clicking on the "Create service account" button. Follow the prompts to create a new service account with the desired name and permissions.

2. Grant the service account the necessary permissions to access the Artifact Registry. You can do this by navigating to the Artifact Registry section of the Google Cloud console and clicking on the "Add member" button. Follow the prompts to add the service account with the desired permissions.

![Grant Access IAM](/static/blog/ci-cd-github-actions-gcp/grant_access.webp)
`Grant Access IAM`

![Grant Access Repo Artifact](/static/blog/ci-cd-github-actions-gcp/grant_access_repo_artifact.webp)
`Grant Access Repository Artifact`

3. Generate a JSON key file for the service account. You can do this by navigating to the service account section of the Google Cloud console and clicking on the "Keys" tab. Follow the prompts to generate a new JSON key file for the service account.

![Create New Service Key](/static/blog/ci-cd-github-actions-gcp/create_secret_key.webp)

Once you have created the service account and generated the JSON key file, you can add the credentials to your GitHub repository. You can do this by navigating to the "Settings" tab of your repository in the GitHub website and clicking on the "Secrets" button. Follow the prompts to add the JSON key file as a secret with the name `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`.

## Step 6: Securely manage authentication

To securely manage authentication, you can use GitHub Actions secrets. Secrets are encrypted environment variables that can be accessed by your workflow. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Create a new secret in your GitHub repository. You can do this by navigating to the "Settings" tab of your repository in the GitHub website and clicking on the "Secrets" button. Follow the prompts to create a new secret with the desired name and value. In this case, we will use the JSON key file as the value.

![Github Action Secret](/static/blog/ci-cd-github-actions-gcp/add_action_secret.webp)
![Github Actions](/static/blog/ci-cd-github-actions-gcp/github_actions.webp)

2. Add the secret to your workflow. You can do this by adding the following code to the `build` job in your workflow:

```yaml
      - name: Google Cloud Platform Auth
        uses: "google-github-actions/auth@v1"
        with:
          credentials_json: "${{ secrets.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}"

      - name: "Set up Cloud SDK"
        uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1
```

This will ensure that the JSON key file is securely stored and used in your workflow.
