  "description": "As the sun sets below the horizon, the sky glows with warm hues of orange, pink, and purple. A flying fish gracefully leaps above the water, its fins catching the last rays of sunlight. Below, majestic whales surface, their massive forms silhouetted against the glowing backdrop. The calm ocean reflects the vibrant colors of the setting sun, creating a stunning scene where the sea and sky merge in a moment of natural wonder.",
