  "description": "As the sun sets, the sky is filled with gold and crimson, casting a warm glow over the calm ocean. In the distance, whales surface, their sleek bodies gleaming in the fading light. The gentle ripples of their movements catch the last rays of sunlight, creating shimmering trails across the water. This stunning sight captures the beauty and majesty of nature, as the whales emerge from the depths, shadowed by the vibrant colors of the setting sun.",
